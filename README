Fast Python Url Shortener (FPUS)

It's a very simple URL shortener to run on Google App Engine.

First, set up an App Engine account. It's better if you use a custom domain name.

Set or not a password in short.py to protect shortening

Push all the files onto the server.

To shorten an url use format 
	http://yoururl/short?
		url=shortenurl
		[&pwd=password]
